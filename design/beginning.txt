You'd seen the ring of mushrooms
before—half-hidden beneath leaves on the
edge of the old trail. Something about
it always made you pause. This morning,
you stepped across it.

The air changed. The forest around you
deepened into twilight. Colors
shimmered. Silence thickened. You
weren’t sure if you were dreaming, but
it felt familiar—as if you'd been here
before, long ago, or in sleep.

Now you're surrounded by strange
beauty... and quiet sorrow. Something in
this place is wrong. The trees whisper
it. The stones remember it.

There’s a wound here. You can feel it.

And you know, somehow, that you are
meant to set it right.
